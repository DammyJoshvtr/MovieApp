-------------React Native Component snippet------------------

import {View, Text, StyleSheet} from 'react-native'
import React from 'react'

const id = () => {
    return(
        <View>
            <Text>id</Text>
        </View>
    )
}

export default id

const styles = StyleSheet.create({})


--------------------- Dynamic Routing --------------------
file name of component should be in square brackets like [id].tsx

then you can now use the expo feature
const { id } = useLocalSearchParams()
----------------------------------------------------------

------------------- To remove the ugly header at the top -----------------
return (<Stack>
        <Stack.Screen
        name="(tabs)"
        options={{ headerShown: false }}/>

        <Stack.Screen
        name="movie/[id]"
        options={{ headerShown: false }}/>
    </Stack>;)

 the use of Screen.Screen was used

 ADVISE ON BUILDING LOGIC ON YOUR OWN
 -------------------------------------------------------

 This is a very good question, and honestly it’s the question that separates tutorial followers from real developers.

I’ll be very direct and practical with you.

🧠 WHY YOU FEEL STUCK WITH LOGIC (this is normal)

Right now, your brain is trained to:

Recognize patterns

Not create solutions from scratch

Tutorials do this:

“Follow → Copy → It works”

But real logic is:

“Problem → Think → Try → Fail → Fix”

That gap is exactly what you’re feeling.

🔑 CORE RULE (memorize this)

Logic is not learned by watching.
Logic is learned by struggling.

If you don’t struggle, your brain doesn’t grow.

🧩 STEP-BY-STEP SYSTEM TO BUILD LOGIC (this works)
1️⃣ ALWAYS WRITE THE PROBLEM IN ENGLISH FIRST

Before touching code, ask:

❓ What EXACTLY should happen?

Example (your saved movie issue):

❌ “Unsave is not working”
✅ “When I click unsave, remove the movie from Firestore AND from the UI immediately.”

Write it down.

2️⃣ BREAK IT INTO SMALL STEPS (VERY SMALL)

Ask yourself:

Where is the data coming from?

Where is it stored?

What changes when I click?

Example:

User clicks Unsave

Firestore deletes the movie

Local list still contains it ❌

UI must remove it ✅

Now the solution becomes obvious:
👉 Remove it from local state

3️⃣ ASK “WHAT STATE SHOULD CHANGE?”

This is the most important React question.

If the UI doesn’t update, one of these is wrong:

State didn’t change

Component doesn’t know state changed

So you ask:

“Which useState should change?”

If you can answer that, you can solve 70% of bugs.

4️⃣ BUILD WITHOUT GOOGLE (for 20–30 minutes)

This is painful, but necessary.

Rule:

❌ No YouTube

❌ No ChatGPT

❌ No StackOverflow

Just:

console.log

thinking

failing

After 30 minutes, then search.

Your brain grows in the struggle phase, not the solution phase.

5️⃣ REBUILD FEATURES YOU ALREADY KNOW

This is 🔥 powerful.

Rebuild:

Save / Unsave

Todo list

Like button

Cart system

But:

❌ No tutorial

❌ No copying

✅ Just logic

If it takes you 3 days — GOOD.

🛠 PRACTICAL EXERCISES (do these)
🟢 Exercise 1: Toggle Logic
// Click button → toggle saved state


Ask:

What is the state?

What changes?

🟢 Exercise 2: Filter Logic
// Remove item from array by id


Force yourself to write:

array.filter(...)


without help.

🟢 Exercise 3: Sync UI with Backend
// Delete from DB → update UI


Same problem you just solved.

🧠 MENTAL SHIFT YOU NEED

Stop asking:

“What code do I write?”

Start asking:

“What changed?”

UI is just a reflection of state.

🚫 BIGGEST MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ Watching 5 tutorials in a row
❌ Copy-pasting without understanding
❌ Thinking you’re “not smart enough”

You are exactly where you should be.

🧭 SIMPLE DAILY ROUTINE (30–60 mins)

Build one small feature

Break it in English

Fail

Fix

Write what you learned (even 3 lines)

Do this daily → logic improves fast.

💬 REAL TALK (important)

Every good dev you admire:

Was confused

Felt stupid

Broke things constantly

The difference?
👉 They didn’t quit

You’re already doing the hard part by asking why.

If you want, next I can:

Give you logic-only challenges

Review your thinking, not just code

Teach you how seniors debug mentally

Just tell me 👍
